# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning & MCTS with PyTorch

This project demonstrates key reinforcement learning techniques applied to both cooperative and competitive environments. It includes:

- **Deep Q-Learning for Multi-Agent Coordination**
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a Policy-Value Network**
- **Classical Q-Iteration and Value Iteration for Tabular Environments**

## Highlights

- Implemented a **custom multi-agent environment** and trained agents using **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** with experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and PyTorch-based modeling.
- Built a **self-play reinforcement learning pipeline** using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** integrated with a shared policyâ€“value network.
- Compared classic **tabular RL techniques** (Value Iteration, Q-Iteration) with function approximation methods.

## Tech Stack

- Python, NumPy
- PyTorch (TorchScript for model saving)
- Custom RL environments
- Matplotlib for visualizations
